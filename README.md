# üõçÔ∏è ALX Shopfront

Dynamic e-commerce product catalog built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Redux**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
This project is my **capstone submission** for the **ALX ProDev Frontend Engineering Program**.

## üìñ Overview  
ALX Shopfront is a responsive, feature-rich e-commerce product catalog where users can browse, filter, and sort products seamlessly. It demonstrates best practices in **API integration**, **state management**, and **modern UI/UX design**‚Äîskills I‚Äôve developed and refined throughout the ALX program.

## üöÄ Major Learnings  
### üîë Key Technologies Covered  
- **Web Development & PWA Concepts** ‚Äì Creating scalable, performant, and offline-ready frontends.  
- **React + Redux (with TypeScript)** ‚Äì For building modular components and managing complex application state.  
- **TailwindCSS** ‚Äì For modern, responsive UI design.  
- **API Integration** ‚Äì Fetching and displaying dynamic data efficiently.

### üí° Important Frontend Concepts  
- Responsive design and accessibility best practices.  
- Pagination and infinite scrolling for performance optimization.  
- Filtering and sorting to improve product discovery.  
- Error handling, loading states, and user-friendly interactions.  
- Git workflow and version control for collaborative, professional development.

### ‚ö° Challenges Faced & Solutions  
- **Performance optimization:** Implemented infinite scrolling and lazy image loading to handle large datasets smoothly.  
- **State complexity:** Used Redux slices and TypeScript interfaces to keep state predictable and maintainable.  
- **Responsive layout:** Applied Tailwind‚Äôs grid and flex utilities to ensure the catalog adapts beautifully across devices.

## üß© Project Architecture  
Below is a placeholder for your project architecture diagram. Replace it with your final diagram once ready:  
![Architecture Diagram Placeholder](./docs/architecture-diagram.png)  
> *Diagram idea:* Show how the frontend (React/Redux) connects to the API, how components communicate with Redux, and the flow of data (fetch ‚Üí store ‚Üí UI).
